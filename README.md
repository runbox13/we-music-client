# ASD 41026 - Project `feature/playlist-management`

This repository contains the front end react application which uses the [we-music-api](https://github.com/peefeeyatko/we-music-api) backend service.

The We-Music project is about creating an application for users to gather and watch & listen to music altogehter as a community with a rotating communal DJ. There are music rooms that can be created by users and joined by users that contain a chatbox, DJ options, track like & dislike, a music video playing and more. Each user also has a playlist that they can add their favourite songs to.
